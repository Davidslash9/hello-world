first repostory

Hello there, my name is David.
I live in Belgium and i work in a company called "Slash9.tv".
It's a small and young company that mainly creates video content, for example: 
multicam captations, multicam livestreams, video edits like testimonials and aftermovies, and much more...
Since we are going towards a future in video using IP, i set myself a goal to also learn how to code.
To write scripts and programs that can be used in a professional way to ease workload or do cool things that would not be possible otherwise.

I'm new to Github & programming in general, but let's start the journey!
